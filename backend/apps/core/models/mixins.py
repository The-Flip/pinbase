    - entity_type_plural: str — hyphenated canonical plural form (e.g. 'corporate-entities')

    Subclasses may override:
    - public_id_field: str — name of the field carrying URL identity. Defaults
      to ``"slug"``. Multi-segment models materialize the path into a
      ``unique=True`` field and point this at it (Location: ``"location_path"``).
    - public_id_form_field: str — name of the form input from which
      ``public_id_field`` is derived at create time. Defaults to
      ``public_id_field`` itself (the form input is the public id directly,
      as for every shipped model that uses ``"slug"``). Override on models
      whose public id is server-derived from another input — Location's
      ``location_path`` is built from the user's ``slug`` input plus the
      parent's path. Used by collision pre-checks to surface the error
      keyed under the form field the user can actually fix.

    identity of a kind of entity — the single source of truth consumed by

    UI labels derive from them; they do not drive backend behavior beyond
    URL and UI consistency.

    additionally inherit ``apps.core.wikilinks.WikilinkableModel``, which
